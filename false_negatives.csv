2,1884,1884,Vollenweider F.X. and Vontobel P. and Hell D. and Leenders K.L.,5-HT modulation of dopamine release in basal ganglia in psilocybin-induced psychosis in Man - A PET study with [11C]raclopride,"The modulating effects of serotonin on dopamine neurotransmission are not well understood, particularly in acute psychotic states. Positron emission tomography was used to examine the effect of psilocybin on the in vivo binding of [11C]raclopride to D2-dopamine receptors in the striatum in healthy volunteers after placebo and a psychotomimetic dose of psilocybin (n = 7). Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19%) and putamen (20%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses. The present results indirectly support the hypothesis of a serotonin-dopamine dysbalance in schizophrenia and suggest that psilocybin is a valuable tool in the analysis of serotonin-dopamine interactions in acute psychotic states.

3,994,994,Carhart-Harris R,5-HT2A agonist drugs as new treatments in psychiatry,"Psilocybin is a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in certain mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for a variety of conditions, including: end of life anxiety [1], obsessive compulsive disorder [2] and smoking [3] and alcohol dependence [4], with promising preliminary results. The present study aimed to investigate psilocybin's safety and efficacy in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (6 females) with moderate to severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. Psychological support was provided before, during and after each session. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months posttreatment, with the QIDS-16 serving as the primary outcome. Treatment was well-tolerated by all of the patients. No unexpected and only a small number of minor adverse events were observed. Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference = -11.8, 95% CI, -5 to -17, Cohen's d = 3.4) and 3 months post-treatment (mean QIDS difference = -9.2, 95% CI, +3 to -17, Cohen's d = 2.3). Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also observed. This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of a novel intervention for treatment-resistant depression. It should motivate further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach.",NA,2016,"European neuropsychopharmacology.

3,1819,433,Rabin R.A. and Regina M. and Doat M. and Winter J.C.,5-HT2A receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the stimulus effects of hallucinogens,"The role of 5-HT2A-mediated stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the discriminative effects of hallucinogens was investigated in PC12 cells stably expressing the rat 5-HT2A receptor (PC12-5-HT2A cells). The hallucinogenic compounds, D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), (-)2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (MDMT) and N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET), all caused a concentration-dependent increase in the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates. The nonhallucinogenic compounds, 6-fluoro-N,N-diethyltryptamine (6-F-DET), lisuride and quipazine, also displayed significant efficacy in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis, while 2-bromo-lysergic acid diethylamide (BOL), which is not a hallucinogen, did not alter inositol phosphate generation. The beta-carbolines, harmaline and harmane, also did not alter phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Comparison of these results with previous drug discrimination studies indicated the apparent lack of correlation between the degree of substitution in LSD- and DOM-trained animals and efficacy in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The present study indicates that 5-HT2A-mediated stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis does not appear to be the sole critical signaling mechanism involved in the discriminative effects of hallucinogens.

10,3040,3040,"Stolk, Jon M and Barchas, J. D and Goldstein, M and Boggan, W and Freedman, D. X",A comparison of psychotomimetic drug effects on rat brain norepinephrine,"Studied the effects of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, amphetamine, and cold water swimming stress on the metabolism of -sup-3H-norepinephrine (NE) in rat brain. Graded doses (130-1300 mug/kg) of LSD had no specific effects, suggesting that it has little direct activity on brain noradrenergic neurons. Psilocybin (25 mg/kg) had effects similar to those obtained with amphetamine (2 mg/kg), as evidenced by a prominent and sustained elevation in -sup-3H-normetanephrine content, a finding consistent with an increased release of NE from central nerve endings. Cold water swim stress resulted in a profound increase in -sup-3H-deaminated catechol metabolites, suggesting that the intracellular catabolism of NE was affected specifically. Mescaline (25 mg/kg) had a biphasic effect on NE metabolism. Shortly after injection, these Ss had a metabolite pattern similar to those of Ss exposed to cold water swimming; 90 min to 4 hrs after mescaline, however, -sup-3H-normetanephrine levels were elevated markedly. Mescaline appears to cause an initial increase in intracellular NE metabolism, followed by an enhanced release similar to the effects of amphetamine and psilocybin. Data indicate that these 3 psychotomimetic drugs share no single common effect on brain NE metabolism.

19,2798,2798,"Zamaria, Joseph A",A phenomenological examination of psilocybin use and its positive and persisting aftereffects,"This dissertation examined the positive and persisting aftereffects in eight individuals who consumed psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Mushrooms containing psilocybin have been used for healing and spiritual purposes for thousands of years, and the therapeutic applications of psilocybin were scientifically examined in the mid-20th century. Research from this era suggested that psilocybin was indicated as an effective adjunct to psychotherapy for conditions such as depression, anxiety, chemical dependency, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. After research into the therapeutic utility of psilocybin halted for several decades, it resumed in the early 2000s. Some recent research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has suggested that participants who consumed psilocybin described having profoundly meaningful experiences, and that these participants experienced persisting and positive changes to their mood, attitude, and behavior at 1-month and 14-month follow up. However, there has not been any research examining the mechanism of the connection between participants' experience with psilocybin and the existence of these positive and persisting aftereffects. This study employed a phenomenological approach, using an unstructured interview to gain an understanding of participants' description of this mechanism. Eight adults were interviewed who reported using psilocybin in the past. A within-case analysis and cross-case analysis were conducted on the data, producing 11 themes within three categories: Set, which included the themes of Preliminary Anxiety and Substantial Preparation; Experience of Psilocybin Effect, which included the themes of Profound Shift in Attention, Unity Consciousness, Increased Introspection, Positive Emotional State, and Transcendental Experience; and Persisting Aftereffects, which included the themes of Short Term Reduction in Anxiety, Persisting Insight, Assistance with Psychological Distress, and Inspired Behavioral Change. It appears that using psilocybin for the purpose of psychological and spiritual growth and introspection allowed participants to experience themselves differently than in their normal state of consciousness, encouraging a deep and unique period of self-examination. Participants brought insights gained from their psilocybin experience into their lives, maintaining that awareness far beyond the course of the substance. This research suggests that the positive and persisting aftereffects of psilocybin may be useful and that these aftereffects should be studied further.

21,1451,2841,Burdick B.V. and Adinoff B.,A proposal to evaluate mechanistic efficacy of hallucinogens in addiction treatment,"Current treatments for addiction are frequently ineffective. Hallucinogenic therapy has been indicated as helpful for a range of substance use disorders, yet this approach remains understudied and publicly unavailable. It is nonetheless a promising treatment, which has significant, long-term beneficial effects with single doses and a profile characterized by general safety, low toxicity, and non-addictiveness. However, pharmacological interventions, such as hallucinogens, should not be offered if the same effects (e.g. psychological insights/mystical experiences) and outcomes (e.g. decreased drug use) could be achieved absent pharmacological intervention. To date, there have been no clinical comparisons of drug-induced altered states with non-drug-induced states for addiction treatment. We propose and then outline a clinical trial to address this gap in knowledge. The proposed design would evaluate abstinence outcomes in a population of prescription opioid abusers after exposure to one of three conditions: a drug-induced altered state using psilocybin, a non-drug-induced altered state via hyperventilation (Holotropic Breathwork), and an active placebo with niacin. The outcomes of such a study would reveal important differences in therapeutic potential by discriminating hallucinogen-dependent effects from those psychological effects resulting from altered states.

Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 mug/kg vs placebo) on both alpha oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital alpha power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced alpha power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of alpha oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

We therefore analysed acute, short- and long-term subjective effects of psilocybin in healthy humans by pooling raw data from eight double-blind placebo-controlled experimental studies conducted between 1999 and 2008. The analysis included 110 healthy subjects who had received 1-4 oral doses of psilocybin (45-315 micro g/kg body weight). Although psilocybin dose-dependently induced profound changes in mood, perception, thought and self-experience, most subjects described the experience as pleasurable, enriching and non-threatening. Acute adverse drug reactions, characterized by strong dysphoria and/or anxiety/panic, occurred only in the two highest dose conditions in a relatively small proportion of subjects. All acute adverse drug reactions were successfully managed by providing interpersonal support and did not need psychopharmacological intervention. Follow-up questionnaires indicated no subsequent drug abuse, persisting perception disorders, prolonged psychosis or other long-term impairment of functioning in any of our subjects. The results suggest that the administration of moderate doses of psilocybin to healthy, high-functioning and well-prepared subjects in the context of a carefully monitored research environment is associated with an acceptable level of risk.

Robin Carhart-Harris et al. deserve much praise for effectively and safely completing an important clinical investigation into the effect of psilocybin on treatment-resistant depression, in the face of many regulatory and practical hurdles. Findings from their study-an uncontrolled trial in which 12 patients were given two doses of psilocybin 7 days apart, reported in The Lancet Psychiatry-support the feasibility and safety of this protocol, with preliminary efficacy data suggesting an antidepressant effect. New treatments for the substantial proportion of patients with depression who do not recover well with either cognitive psychotherapy or medication are certainly needed. Unfortunately, the development of new, more effective medicines through the usual industry-led process of drug discovery has stalled. The concept underlying the use of psychedelic agents such as psilocybin seems quite different, namely that administration of one or two doses results in profound, spiritually meaningful experiences that produce enduring gains in wellbeing and personal adjustment. The possible therapeutic use of psilocybin in treatment-resistant depression comes at a time of intense debate about the harms of recreational drug use and the role of government and the criminal justice system in regulation.

Johnson et al.'s pilot study of psilocybin for tobacco smoking cessation adds to this growing body of literature and is noteworthy for a number of reasons. It is the first clinical trial of a classic psychedelic for an addictive behavior in over 4 decades and the first such trial focused on the treatment of tobacco dependence ever. One might question the wisdom of treating drug addiction with an abusable drug. It is critical to underscore that while classic psychedelics are sometimes used dangerously in recreational contexts, multiple lines of evidence show that they do not lead to compulsive drug-seeking behavior. In several ways classic psychedelics might represent the ideal addiction medications in that they are not addictive themselves; need only be administered in a few controlled and monitored sessions; and often provide individuals with extraordinarily meaningful spiritual experiences.

Two articles in this issue, Ross et al. and Griffiths et al., describe the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression and anxiety in cancer patients. Psilocybin is a plant alkaloid derived from the Psilocybe genus of mushrooms that has been used for centuries, if not millennia, by indigenous cultures for ritualized healing and religious purposes. Ross et al. administered psilocybin or active placebo (niacin) to patients with life-threatening cancer, and assessed effects on anxiety and depression, as well as mystical experience and quality of life. A greater concern is the lack of understanding of the mechanism of action of psychedelic drugs. The work presented in this issue by Griffiths et al. and Ross et al., beyond its obvious implications for patients with comorbid advanced cancer and depression and anxiety, serves as a model for revisiting criminalized compounds of interest in a safe, ethical way. Should more members of the biomedical community follow their lead, there is much potential for new scientific insights and clinical applications.

Prospective, observational study. Pregnant women who have contacted the Motherisk Alcohol and Substance Use Helpline at The Hospital for Sick Children, in Toronto, about exposure to drugs, chemicals, infection or radiation. All inquiries from December 1998 to October 2000 concerning pregnant women who reported use of MDMA, and control cases of women not exposed to MDMA selected within the same week of the MDMA callers. Age, maternal demographics, pregnancy characteristics, patterns of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use, psychological/emotional status, sexually transmitted disease, MDMA method and pattern of use, and adverse drug reactions after ingestion of MDMA. The 132 pregnant women who used MDMA were significantly younger (mean 23.2 vs. 31.2 years, P<.0001), and had more unplanned pregnancies compared to 122 pregnant nonusers (84.2% vs. 54.3%, P<.05). MDMA users were also more likely to be single (57.0% vs. 18.3%, P<.001), and to be White (82.2% vs. 56.0%, P<.05). Comparably more MDMA users smoked cigarettes (53.8% vs. 19.7%, P<.0001), drank alcohol (66.4% vs. 37.3%, P<.0001), and had significantly more episodes of binge drinking during pregnancy (mean 2.12 vs. 0.05, P<.001).

Pregnant women who use MDMA tend to be young, single, and report psychological morbidity, and have a clustering of risk factors that may compromise the pregnancy and fetus. Smoking, heavy alcohol intake, and polydrug use, combined with a higher than expected rate of unplanned pregnancies, increases the risk of fetal exposure to potentially harmful substances.

The design involved using 30 mg/70 kg of psilocybin as the active experimental agent and 40 mg/70 kg of methylphenidate as an active control. The blinding was done so carefully that even the experienced monitors misidentified the administered agent approximately one quarter of the time. This study suggests a number of possibilities, both basic and translational, that should merit NIH support. The positive findings of the study cannot help but raise concern in some that it will lead to increased experimenting with these substances by youth in the kind of uncontrolled and unmonitored fashion that produced casualties over the past three decades.

This article is the first well-designed, placebo-controlled, clinical study in more than four decades to examine the psychological consequences of the effects of the hallucinogenic agent known as psilocybin. The study convincingly demonstrates that, when used appropriately, these compounds can produce remarkable, possibly beneficial, effects that certainly deserve further study. The parallel between mystical states and the effects of psychedelic drugs is well-known among those familiar with the literature. Clearly, these substances have profound effects on human consciousness, and in the 1950s and 1960s, the drug known as LSD was hailed as a revolutionary new technology for psychiatry. The authors have done in their present work represents an important extension of Pahnke's ""Good Friday"" experiment. The subjects in the study were not theology students, but were simply ordinary people with an interest in spiritual things. The work demonstrates that, under appropriate experimental conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical states.

The study by Griffiths et al. is noteworthy both for the rigorousness of its design and execution, as well as the clarity of its results. It demonstrates that psilocybin can be safely studied in normal human beings who do not have a history of hallucinogenic drug use. The term psychedelic, when applied to drugs, implies that the drug experience is ""mind-expanding."" The paper illustrates the accuracy of this description for psilocybin, and I hope that this landmark paper will also be ""field-expanding."" The report clearly demonstrates that we can objectively study the experiences reported by many to be profoundly spiritual and meaningful, and that we can investigate the long-term positive consequences for the individual's attitudes and behavior. I hope that this paper renews interest in a fascinating and potentially useful class of psychotropic agents. Understanding the brain mechanisms mediating these effects is clearly within the realm of neuroscience and deserves further intensive investigation.

(see record 2006-23483-006). The authors proposing that altered states of consciousness induced by pharmacological treatments and neurological disorders can reveal much about the circuitry underlying time perception in normal states of consciousness. Further research is needed to integrate these separate research domains. Wittmann et al. investigated time estimation under the influence of psilocybin. The study addressed the functional role of serotoninergic 5-HT2A receptors in internal clock models (ICMs) in duration discrimination and temporal control of motor performance. The study revealed a decreased ability to accurately produce intervals longer than 3 s and synchronize finger-tapping to auditory beats separated by more than 2 s. This suggests that effects of psilocybin on temporal processing are specific to relatively long durations, attributable to memory, and decision-making components of the ICM, rather than to more basic pacemaker/accumulator mechanisms (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00736 and http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00736,2016,Frontiers in Psychology,7,NA,"NA-NA",NA,NA,NA

Psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and many others include synthetic chemicals and the active ingredients in psychoactive extracts of plants that have been used since time immemorial for their mind-altering properties. These agents were first employed for religious purposes, evidently to facilitate contact with the supernatural. The rampant abuse of psychedelic drugs in the late 1960s led to strict controls with such severe restrictions that clinical and even laboratory research virtually vanished. Griffiths et al. now report a rigorous, blinded study of mystical experiences associated with psilocybin. The observation that psilocybin reliably elicits a transcendent, mystical state tells us that investigations of these drugs may help us understand molecular alterations in the brain that underlie mystical religious experiences. By showing that one can responsibly conduct clinical research with psychedelic drugs and by confirming the mystical influences of these agents, the authors may help resurrect psychedelic drugs as major tools in probing the molecular bases of consciousness.

In the mid-20th century, considerable advances were made in developing therapeutic approaches integrating administration of low (psycholytic) and high (psychedelic) doses of serotonergic hallucinogens for treatment of a variety of conditions, often incorporating psychoanalytic concepts prevalent at that time. This work contributed seminal insights regarding how these substances may be employed with efficacy and safety in targeted therapeutic interventions, including the importance of optimizing set (frame of mind) and setting (therapeutic environment). More recently, clinical and pharmacological research has revisited the effects and therapeutic potential of psychedelics utilizing a variety of approaches. The current article provides an overview of past and present models of psychedelic therapy, and discusses important considerations for future interventions incorporating the use of psychedelics in research and clinical practice.Copyright Â© 2018, Â© 2018 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2018.1486289,2018,Int.

Psilocin is the active metabolite of psilocybin, a hallucinogen that is currently being investigated clinically as a potential therapeutic agent. In the present investigation, we used a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to identify the serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes responsible for mediating the effects of psilocin on head twitch response (HTR) and the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) in C57BL/6J mice. We also compared the effects of psilocin with those of the putative 5-HT2C receptor-selective agonist 1-methylpsilocin and the hallucinogen and non-selective serotonin receptor agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT). Psilocin, 1-methylpsilocin, and 5-MeO-DMT induced the HTR, effects that were absent in mice lacking the 5-HT2A receptor gene. When tested in the BPM, psilocin decreased locomotor activity, holepoking, and time spent in the center of the chamber, effects that were blocked by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 but were not altered by the selective 5-HT2C antagonist SB 242,084 or by 5-HT2A receptor gene deletion. 5-MeO-DMT produced similar effects when tested in the BPM, and the action of 5-MeO-DMT was significantly attenuated by WAY-100635. Psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT also decreased the linearity of locomotor paths, effects that were mediated by 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors, respectively. In contrast to psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT, 1-methylpsilocin (0.6-9.6mg/kg) was completely inactive in the BPM. These findings confirm that psilocin acts as an agonist at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors in mice, whereas the behavioral effects of 1-methylpsilocin indicate that this compound is acting at 5-HT2A sites but is inactive at the 5-HT1A receptor.

Methods: Twenty hallucinogen users (11 females) completed neurocognitive assessments during five blinded drug administration sessions (10, 20, and 30 mg/70 kg psilocybin; 400 mg/70 kg DXM; and placebo) in which participants and study staff were informed that a large range of possible drug conditions may have been administered. Results: Global cognitive impairment, assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination during peak drug effects, was not observed with psilocybin or DXM. Orderly and dose-dependent effects of psilocybin were observed on psychomotor performance, working memory, episodic memory, associative learning, and visual perception. Effects of DXM on psychomotor performance, visual perception, and associative learning were in the range of effects of a moderate to high dose (20 to 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin. Conclusions: This was the first study of the dose effects of psilocybin on a large battery of neurocognitive assessments. Evidence of delirium or global cognitive impairment was not observed with either psilocybin or DXM. Psilocybin had greater effects than DXM on working memory. DXM had greater effects than all psilocybin doses on balance, episodic memory, response inhibition, and executive control.Copyright Â© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-018-4981-x,2018,Psychopharmacology,235,10,2915-2927,NA,NA,NA

Objective: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. Methods: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. Results: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance. Conclusions: Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.

The primary objective is to determine the extent to which psilocybin (PSOP) modulates neurogenesis and thereby affects acquisition and extinction of HPC-dependent trace fear conditioning. PSOP, the 5-HT2Aagonist 25I-NBMeO and the 5-HT 2A/Cantagonist ketanserin were administered via an acute intraperitoneal injection to mice. Trace fear conditioning was measured as the amount of time spent immobile in the presence of the conditioned stimulus (CS, auditory tone), trace (silent interval) and post-trace interval over 10 trials. Extinction was determined by the number of trials required to resume mobility during CS, trace and post-trace when the shock was not delivered. Neurogenesis was determined by unbiased counts of cells in the dentate gyrus of the HPC birthdated with BrdU co-expressing a neuronal marker. Mice treated with a range of doses of PSOP acquired a robust conditioned fear response. Mice injected with low doses of PSOP extinguished cued fear conditioning significantly more rapidly than high-dose PSOP or saline-treated mice. Injection of PSOP, 25I-NBMeO or ketanserin resulted in significant dose-dependent decreases in number of newborn neurons in hippocampus. At the low doses of PSOP that enhanced extinction, neurogenesis was not decreased, but rather tended toward an increase. Extinction of ""fear conditioning"" may be mediated by actions of the drugs at sites other than hippocampus such as the amygdala, which is known to mediate the perception of fear. Another caveat is that PSOP is not purely selective for 5-HT2A receptors. PSOP facilitates extinction of the classically conditioned fear response, and this, and similar agents, should be explored as potential treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder and related conditions.

Drugs of both classes are being pursued as novel treatments for mood disorders. While classic and dissociative hallucinogens have different pharmacologic mechanisms of action, they may have similar subjective and neuropsychological effects. The objective of this double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study was to compare the neuropsychological effects of multiple doses of the classic hallucinogen psilocybin with the effects of a single high dose of the dissociative hallucinogen dextromethorphan. Methods: Twenty hallucinogen users (11 F, 9M) completed five drug administration sessions lasting 6 to 8 hours each. During each session, volunteers self-administered capsules containing placebo, one of three doses (10, 20, and 30 mg/ 70 kg) of psilocybin, or a dose dextromethorphan (DXM; 400 mg/70 kg). Dose order was counter-balanced across volunteers using a 5-order Williams design. Before capsule administration and at peak drug effect, volunteers were assessed for overall cognitive impairment using the Mini- Mental State Examination. Computerized neuropsychological tasks measuring psychomotor performance (the Motor Praxis test), working (the Letter N-Back test) and episodic memory (word encoding, recall, and recognition), executive function and associative learning (the Digit Symbol Substitution Task, or DSST), and visual perception (the Penn Line Orientation Task, or PLOT) were assessed at various points throughout the timecourse of drug effects. The DSST and episodic memory tasks were programmed within the Presentation software package. The Motor Praxis, Letter N-Back, and PLOT tasks were administered as part of the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). Multiple task forms were administered in order to minimize learning effects. Task order was counterbalanced across participants, and orthogonalized in relation to dose order. Outcome measures for each task were analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures ANCOVA using the lmer function of the lme4 library and the lmerTest library within the R statistical environment. Responses were nested within subject, testing a main effect of drug condition and using average mpraxis response times for the given assessment period as a covariate to control for general effects of psychomotor slowing on performance of each task. For the DSST and Letter N-Back analyses, responses were also nested within drug condition and a main effect of time point (for the DSST) or task condition (for the Letter N-Back) was included, as DSST was assessed at multiple timepoints within each session, and the Letter N-Back contained multiple task conditions. Results: Overall cognitive impairment, as assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination, was not observed with psilocybin or DXM. Orderly and dose-dependent effects of psilocybin were observed, and consisted of impairments of psychomotor performance, working memory, episodic memory, associative learning, and visual perception. Effects of a high dose of DXM were observed, and consisted of impairments of psychomotor performance, working memory, visual perception, and associative learning that were in the range of effects of a moderate to high dose (20 to 30 mg/ 70 kg) of psilocybin. Psilocybin had greater effects than DXM on measures of working memory. DXM had greater effects than all doses of psilocybin on measures of word recognition sensitivity, response inhibition, and executive control. Conclusions: Psilocybin exerted selective effects on working memory, whereas DXM selective effects on episodic memory, response inhibition, and executive control. Notably, this is the first time that dose-dependent effects of psilocybin were demonstrated for measures related to verbal working memory, episodic memory, and executive function. Future studies should determine whether any of these component processes of cognition are necessary, sufficient, or supportive of therape tic outcomes associated with classic psychedelics or dissociative hallucinogens.",NA,2017,Neuropsychopharmacology,43 (Supplement 1),NA,S287-NA,NA,NA,NA

Conclusions: Psilocybin exerted selective effects on working memory, whereas DXM selective effects on episodic memory, response inhibition, and executive control. Notably, this is the first time that dose-dependent effects of psilocybin were demonstrated for measures related to verbal working memory, episodic memory, and executive function. Future studies should determine whether any of these component processes of cognition are necessary, sufficient, or supportive of therapeutic outcomes associated with classic psychedelics or dissociative hallucinogens.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npp.2017.264,2017,Neuropsychopharmacology,43,Supplement 1,S287-S288,NA,NA,NA

241,1223,1223,Bourvis N. and Vion-Dury J.,Experiential phenomenology of cluster headache,"Objectives Cluster headache (CH) is a rare disease (1 to 3/1000), predominant in men (sex ratio: four men/one woman) and characterized by frequent very painful paroxystic attacks occurring sometimes eight times by day. CH is a disease without lesion and impairs the quality of life of patients. Attacks occur only on the same hemiface and can last from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The pain is particularly severe and a frequent and extreme psychiatric symptomatology is observed during the attacks. Treatments are rare and not always efficient: sumatriptan, oxygen, LSD, psilocybin. In this paper, we try to answer to the question: ""What does that make you to have a cluster headache attack?"" using elicitation interview developed by Vermersch. Patients and methods Ten patients have been interviewed using elicitation interview (EI) (40-50 min for one interview). All these patients (seven men's and three women's) T suffer from chronic or episodic CH, with a mean age of 43 years. The patients come from the Lariboisiere hospital (Paris), and more precisely from the center of headache urgency. EI allows describing the pre-reflexive consciousness contents. The method is described in Balzani et al., and in Petitmengin et al. (see bibliography). Data analyses were performed using Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results From the EI, we have distinguished three phenomenological axes, following Heidegger's philosophy: (1) An alteration of being-to-the-world with a strong unbearable feeling of imprisonment, and physical restriction. At the same time the patients present a stereotypical and automatic behavior with few motor schemes and escaping strategies. When pain arises, they want to leave and to go very far. Aggressive behaviors frequently occur. Sometimes, the patients are not able to perform the sumatripan injection, due to a motor inhibition. Some patients try to do autohypnosis or other methods to resist to the pain. (2) An alteration of being-to-the self, going from the corporal distortion to the body dissolution. At the onset of symptoms, the patient does the experience of physical deformation, particularly of the face, with strong vegetative symptoms. The patient is not able to control corporeal manifestations: tears, mad thinks, incoherent projects in order to stop the crisis. Some patients want to remove the part of their body where the pain is the most intense (eye, for example). There is a losing of the body limits and a loss of the time orientation. In many cases, the pain is unbearable and patients want to commit suicide. At the extreme, the sensation of self seems destroyed, and some patients evoke an experience similar than Near Death Experiences, or describe an experience of swaying in emptiness or imminent death. (3) An alteration of being-to-the-other, going from the imperative solitude to the acceptance for a presence without words. Solitude is the most experience for the patients. They cannot accept anybody. Another person is unbearable, because asking questions about the crisis. In the same time, the patient is scared of this solitude since he is not able to speak about his painful experience. In summary, the structure of the self is altered, and thinking is completely disturbed. The experience of time and space is modified and a pragmatism is a consequence of this intense pain. During the crisis, pain is central and the patient lives a kind of dissolution, near death: a self-dismantling. Conclusion The EI have allowed us to describe precisely the painful experience of subjects with a cluster headache. This experience is very rich and very intense.

He also describes its application to model psychoses and illustrates this with a report on the preliminary findings as to the effect of the new phantasticum, called psilocybin The expressive change can be divided into 3 phases, which indicate that the drug exerts its effect progressively on ego-distant and ego-proximal areas of the person's basic constitution. Changes in basic condition as deduced from expression correspond closely to those deduced from the person's actual experiences.Comparison of impairment in concentration reveals that this is at its maximum in the phases accompanied by least expressive change (phases 1 and 2) and at a minimum in the 3rd phase, which exhibits the maximum expressive change. Memory performance is uninfluenced but verbal facility is equally impaired in all 3 phases. The findings show that the drug takes effect at different levels and takes time to reach its full effect. Any analogy between model psychoses and genuine psychoses remains doubtful.

A separate group of rats was also trained to recognize DPT itself as a discriminative stimulus, and in all cases, the behavioral effects of DPT were challenged with the selective serotonin (5-HT)2A antagonist M100907, the 5-HT1A selective antagonist WAY-100635, or their combination. In the head-twitch assay, DPT elicited dose-dependent effects, producing a biphasic dose-effect curve.

Objective: This study in humans evaluated the effects of supratherapeutic doses of DXM and triazolam. Methods: Single, acute oral doses of DXM (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 mg/70 kg), triazolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered to 12 healthy volunteers with histories of hallucinogen use, under double-blind conditions, using an ascending dose run-up design. Subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed repeatedly after drug administration for 6 h. Results: Triazolam produced dose-related increases in subject-rated sedation, observer-rated sedation, and behavioral impairment. DXM produced a profile of dose-related physiological and subjective effects differing from triazolam. DXM effects included increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and emesis; increases in observer-rated effects typical of classic hallucinogens (e.g., distance from reality, visual effects with eyes open and closed, joy, anxiety); and participant ratings of stimulation (e.g., jittery, nervous), somatic effects (e.g., tingling, headache), perceptual changes, end-of-session drug liking, and mystical-type experience. After 400 mg/70 kg DXM, 11 of 12 participants indicated on a pharmacological class questionnaire that they thought they had received a classic hallucinogen (e.g., psilocybin). Drug effects resolved without significant adverse effects by the end of the session. In a 1-month follow-up, volunteers attributed increased spirituality and positive changes in attitudes, moods, and behavior to the session experiences.

Some studies have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala responses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala responses (Ma, 2015). We hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be altered post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study, 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe, treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing sessions with psilocybin. Psychological support was provided before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI scans one week prior to the first session and one day after the second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces were presented in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group results revealed rapid and enduring improvements in depressive symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment, and right amygdala increases to fearful versus neutral faces were predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with psychological support was associated with increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to previous findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in these treatments' therapeutic actions, with SSRIs mitigating negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront and work through them. Based on the present results, we propose that psilocybin with psychological support is a treatment approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in depression, enabling patients to reconnect with their emotions.

In this issue, Johnson et al. provide long term outcome data from a smoking cessation pilot study of a treatment model using 2-3 doses of psilocybin in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation. The short term results of this study were remarkable: 12/15 participants (80%) were abstinent at 6-month follow-up, based on the self-report validated by urinary cotinine and breath carbon monoxide levels. The long-term results reported in the current are even more impressive: 10/15 remained abstinent at 12 months, and 9/12 remained abstinent at long-term follow-up (ranging from 16 to 57 months). Such results are unheard of in smoking cessation treatment. In addition, subjects reported no persisting adverse effects from treatment. These results are consistent with results of a proof of-concept study (n = 10) of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol dependence conducted by my research team, which showed robust decreases in drinking, with a pre-post effect size of d > 1 persisting at the final 9-month follow-up visit.

Objectives: To assess long-term effects of a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at >=12 months after psilocybin administration. Methods: The present report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence outcomes of the previous pilot study at >=12 months, and related data on subjective effects of psilocybin. Results: All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80%) returned for a long-term (>=16 months) follow-up, with a mean interval of 30 months (range = 16-57 months) between target-quit date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants (67%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, nine participants (60%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up 13 participants (86.7%) rated their psilocybin experiences among the five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives. Conclusion: These results suggest that in the context of a structured treatment program, psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence.

388,913,913,NA,LSD increases primary process thinking via serotonin 2A receptor activation,"Rationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.

(see record 2014-22635-001). The two articles address the phenomenology and underlying mechanisms of action for two classic psychedelic drugs: lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. Schmid et al. examined the effects of the most famous psychedelic, LSD, which was discovered in Basel, Switzerland, by Hofmann in 1943. Schmid et al. demonstrated that a robust dose of LSD was feasible for studies in healthy volunteers and that it markedly reduced sensorimotor gating as indexed by prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI). This disruption of PPI by LSD mimicked not only the disruption reported in parallel experiments in rodents but also the similar deficit in PPI observed in patients with schizophrenia. Kraehenmann et al. combined state-of-the-art imaging methods with validated clinical rating scales and a well-established affect modulation task to characterize the effects of psilocybin on positive mood and identify circuitry subserving these effects. The articles describing rigorous and sophisticated examinations of the effects of two 5-HT2A agonists, LSD and psilocybin, in healthy human volunteers offer the promise of a resurgence of psychedelic drug research to understand mechanisms underlying their actions and gain insights into normal and abnormal brain function.

Drugs were administered under similar test conditions, doses were constant as between drugs and subjects, assignments to drugs followed a latin-square sequence, and subjects were unaware of the drug given at each trial. Clinical syndromes were assessed by a questionnaire completed by the subjects after each drug trial. Colour perception was studied by means of both adequate and inadequate stimuli for eliciting colour phenomena, measurements being taken before and 2 hours after the drug was administered. A number of selected biochemical and physiological measurements were also made at similar times. Clinical syndromes were comparable in kind and degree for all 3 drugs, that from mescaline being most pronounced. Somatic manifestations predominated, psychotomimetic symptoms (other than visual hallucinations) being relatively uncommon. Colour perception was not altered much when adequate stimuli were used, but colour phenomena were appreciably enhanced from inadequate stimuli. Minor differences in colour perceptual effects were noted between the 3 drugs, but similarities were greater. Each of the 3 drugs significantly decreased urinary excretion of inorganic phosphorus, increased plasma free fatty acids and decreased total circulating eosinophils. Of the other biochemical measurements made, only one other significant change was noted: an increase in copper oxidase activity after psilocybin. The 3 psychotomimetic drugs were quite comparable in the areas studied.

During conditioning a sound which originally had little effect induced a marked and stable evoked response in the occipital area when coupled with light. The drug caused disappearance of this established conditioning, the potentials evoked by the conditioned sound becoming less marked and less stable. It also induced a new type of acquisition as reflected by the appearance of slow, late, marked and generalized phenomena provoked by the conditioned sound. These phenomena reproduced the aspect of the slow waves evoked by light (unconditional stimulus) after ingestion of psilocybine. These changes were very similar to the responses observed after conditioning to sound and light in psychotic children.

When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by the classical serotonin-2A receptor agonist psychedelics. However, unlike substances such as psilocybin or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor rather than at the serotonin-2A receptor. Here, we assessed the involvement of kappa-opioid receptor and serotonin-2A agonism in the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin-A in humans. Methods: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2 groups of 12 healthy volunteers with experience with psychedelic drugs. There were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following treatment combinations: placebo + placebo, placebo + salvinorin-A, naltrexone + placebo, and naltrexone + salvinorin-A. Naltrexone, a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, was administered at a dose of 50 mg orally. In group 2, participants received the treatment combinations: placebo + placebo, placebo + salvinorin-A, ketanserin + placebo, and ketanserin + salvinorin-A. Ketanserin, a selective serotonin-2A antagonist, was administered at a dose of 40 mg orally. Results: Inhalation of 1 mg of vaporized salvinorin-A led to maximum plasma concentrations at 1 and 2 minutes after dosing. When administered alone, salvinorin-A severely reduced external sensory perception and induced intense visual and auditory modifications, increased systolic blood pressure, and cortisol and prolactin release. These effects were effectively blocked by naltrexone, but not by ketanserin. Conclusions: Results support kappa opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective and physiological effects of salvinorin-A in humans and rule out the involvement of a serotonin-2A-mediated mechanism.

There were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, naltrexone+placebo, and naltrexone+salvinorin-A. Naltrexone, a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, was administered at a dose of 50mg orally. In group 2, participants received the treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, ketanserin+placebo, and ketanserin+salvinorin-A. Ketanserin, a selective serotonin-2A antagonist, was administered at a dose of 40mg orally., RESULTS: Inhalation of 1mg of vaporized salvinorin-A led to maximum plasma concentrations at 1 and 2 minutes after dosing. When administered alone, salvinorin-A severely reduced external sensory perception and induced intense visual and auditory modifications, increased systolic blood pressure, and cortisol and prolactin release. These effects were effectively blocked by naltrexone, but not by ketanserin., CONCLUSIONS: Results support kappa opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective and physiological effects of salvinorin-A in humans and rule out the involvement of a serotonin-2A-mediated mechanism.Copyright Â© The Author 2016.

Subjects underwent two scans (control: word repetition; activation: word association) within 2-4 weeks. Psilocybin increased rMRGlu in distinct right hemispheric frontotemporal cortical regions, particularly in the anterior cingulate and decreased rMRGlu in the thalamus. Both MDE and METH induced cortical hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. In the MDE group, cortical hypometabolism was more pronounced in frontal regions, with the exception of the right anterior cingulate, which tended to be hyperactive. Cognitive activation-related increases in left frontocortical regions were attenuated under all three psychoactive substances, but less so under MDE. Taking into account performance data and subjective reports on task difficulty, these effects may result from different mechanisms across the three groups. Our PSI data are in line with studies on acute schizophrenic patients suggesting frontal overactivity at rest, but diminished capacity to activate prefrontal regions upon cognitive demand.

To describe the patterns of drug use at dance (rave) events in terms of prevalence, frequency, type of drugs used, patterns of use, access and risk-associated behaviours. Design. Self-selecting participant-completed survey. Setting. Three dance events in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. Participants. One hundred and twenty-two drug users (57% males, 43% females), 90% of whom were in employment or education, with an age range of 16-47, 80% between 18 and 23 years. Measurements. Participants who answered ""yes"" to the question ""Have you used drugs for dance events in the past year"" reported (i) the prevalence, types and frequency of drugs used; (ii) prevalence and contents of mixing drugs; (iii) accessing drugs; and (iv) engagement with drug-associated risk behaviours. Findings. Over 80% of the participants had used ecstasy and amphetamine, over 30% cocaine and LSD; over 10% nitrites, psilocybin and ketamine and less than 5% had used crack or tranquillizers. Participants reported regular consumption of ecstasy and amphetamine (e.g. 35% used ecstasy and 25% amphetamine on a weekly basis) often taken in combination, with the occasional use of cocaine, LSD, ketamine and psilocybin.

A method for measuring the sensory to motor ratio (S/M) was developed by use of a handwriting task in which the area used to write a preselected 28-word passage and the pen pressure applied are determined as the primary sensory and motor variables, respectively. Also obtained were certain autonomic indicators, i.e., pupillary response. A chemically-induced mild state of hallucinations was achieved by administration of psilocybin to 16 ""predominately taste-sensitive and thus intuitive"" college-age volunteers. Pre- and post-drug base-rate data are presented for area used, pressure, and time to complete the writing task, including intercorrelations between these and additional personality measures obtained on Ss. Initial results suggest that handwriting area and average force are not interrelated, thus demonstrating their utility as an S/M indicator. In addition, drug-induced pupillary response is unrelated to drug-induced change in the sensory parameter (handwriting area), but shows a weak but significant relationship to the motor parameter (handwriting force).

However in the 1950s, concerned scientists used evidence and human rights arguments to defend peyote users, leading to legal exemptions for specific groups. When psychedelics spread to the wider society in the 1960s, this was also acknowledged by religious scholars and governments as a spiritual movement.

Both projects attempted to deal with this problem by using active placebo controls (niacin or lowdose psilocybin) and certain study procedures.

Lessons from the past and prospects for the future,"This editorial presents the current issue of Journal of Psychopharmacology. This special issue contains two landmark studies-the most rigorous controlled trials to date using the psychedelic drug psilocybin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms. These were conducted in patients with anxiety and depression and existential distress in the context of having a diagnosis of cancer, and they showed that a single psychedelic experience could produce profound and enduring mental health benefits. The fact that everyone we approached agreed to provide a commentary, despite short notice, is a testimony to the interest that these two studies have sparked. Unfortunately, psilocybin got caught up in the backlash against LSD occasioned by the protests against the Vietnam War and the Haight-Ashbury social revolution. So when LSD was banned on the basis of some very dubious so-called research findings of harm, psilocybin and all other known psychedelic drugs became illegal too. Hopefully, the positive findings that they report will act to spur on other researchers in the field of psychopharmacology, particularly in relation to depression, anxiety and addiction-disorders of enormous personal and social costs, and with many patients who still fail to respond adequately to current treatments, as well as to patients with existential distress.

Nonetheless, the findings of Griffiths et al. (2016) and Ross et al.

Objectives: Here, we report on safety and efficacy outcomes for up to 6 months in an open-label trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Methods: Twenty patients (six females) with (mostly) severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. Depressive symptoms were assessed from 1 week to 6 months post-treatment, with the self-rated QIDS-SR16 as the primary outcome measure. Results: Treatment was generally well tolerated. Relative to baseline, marked reductions in depressive symptoms were observed for the first 5 weeks post-treatment (Cohen's d = 2.2 at week 1 and 2.3 at week 5, both p < 0.001); nine and four patients met the criteria for response and remission at week 5.

Both the studies raise important regulatory and methodological questions as regulators consider approving follow-on studies leading to general patient access. More specifically, the question is what research is needed now to be able to move the treatment from a randomised controlled environment to larger numbers of patients in a real-world care setting. The results of two well-controlled blinded trials, showing persisting improvements in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer with a single administration of psilocybin-assisted therapy, provide an important opportunity for the clinical management of such patients. Given additional circumstantial data on safety and tolerability of psilocybin, this paves the way for larger pragmatic trials in less selected patients under real-world conditions, including routine care as a comparator, to promote the use of this treatment in clinical practice with confidence.

577,2634,2634,Toscano Aguilar M.,Psilocybin: Possibilities in clinical psychiatry,"Psilocybin is a psychodysleptic drug. In small doses it has a marked psychotonic effect, which wears off after some time. Large doses always produce somatic effects, mostly psychic. An absence of psychic reaction seems to be obvious in cases with blunt affectivity and loss of temporal foresight. If psychic effects do occur, there is an intense emotional revival of hidden psychic contents and problems. At the same time psycho-sensitive alterations are perceived. If psychic contents could be recalled, the drug might be considered for use in analytical procedures. Psilocybin if psychically effective, creates an exceptional situation, which might be made use of in commencing psychotherapy. In this respect it seems to be most important that the patient should simultaneously be able to be actor and spectator in his own life history, because of the personality partition induced by the drug. As a dialogue is made possible between oneself and ones problem contents, it might, under therapeutic guidance, lead to an understanding of the behavioural trends and to a clear insight into the actual situation and the future prospects. In some cases, having discarded these structures of stereotype reaction, the patient might reach a new ego organization, by realising his vital needs. The technique of this form of psychotherapy is thoroughly described and the indications are made clear. The importance of this form of treatment is stressed in the case of criminal youths.",NA,1963,Acta Neurol. Belg,63,2,113-131,NA,NA,NA

This edition of the Journal of Psychopharmacology highlights two very similarly designed studies of the effects of the serotonergic agonist psilocybin on the psychological distress of cancer patients. Psilocybin produced an acute increase in blood pressure and a variety of immediate and obvious subjective effects. The subjective effects were transient and did not lead to persisting abnormal perceptions. The outcome measures of both trials are entirely subjective, comprising self, community and clinician reports, just as most studies of antidepressants and anxiolytics have been. While this is understandable, it is a particular weakness of any study where blinding is inadequate. Any cue that makes participants in an experimental study aware of what the experimenter expects to find or how participants are expected to behave is called a demand characteristic. These studies have demand characteristics in spades. Just as for other studies, symptoms alone are also a limited way of assessing the value of treatment: more objective measures of activity, simply motor or economic, the costs of their cancer care and so on should also be part of the future picture for research in this area.

Ross and colleagues (2016) used a similar crossover design, but with niacin rather than low-dose psilocybin as the control. They found similar reductions in anxiety and depression, associated with personally meaningful and mystical experiences. The factors of those experiences were mystical, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and ineffability. Good psychotherapy involves learning to restructure one's perspective on one's problems in life. Cognitive-behavioral therapy deliberately trains people to challenge routine assumptions and think about problems in new ways. Interpersonal psychotherapy invites people to reflect on patterns of relating and assumptions about how other people think about you. Psychodynamic psychotherapy asks people to introspect about how their earlier life influences who they are, how they transfer experiences of key figures in their life to others and consequently distort their perceptions of them.

The hallucinogen psilocybin disrupts automatic forms of sensorimotor gating and response inhibition in humans, but it is unclear so far whether the 5-HT2AR or 5-HT1AR agonist properties of its bioactive metabolite psilocin account for these effects. Thus, we investigated whether psilocybin-induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition in healthy humans could be attenuated by the 5-HT2A/2CR antagonist ketanserin. A total of 16 healthy participants received placebo, ketanserin (40 mg p.o.), psilocybin (260 mug/kg p.o.), or psilocybin plus ketanserin in a double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced order. Sensorimotor gating was measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response. The effects on psychopathological core dimensions and behavioral inhibition were assessed by the altered states of consciousness questionnaire (5D-ASC), and the Color-Word Stroop Test. Psilocybin decreased PPI at short lead intervals (30 ms), increased all 5D-ASC scores, and selectively increased errors in the interference condition of the Stroop Test. Stroop interference and Stroop effect of the response latencies were increased under psilocybin as well.

(see record 2016-58838-002) & Roland R Griffiths et al. (see record 2016-58838-003). In this issue, Griffiths et al. (2016) and Ross et al. (2016) have published the largest randomized controlled trials of psilocybin for depression and anxiety in cancer patients to date. The researchers used multiple validated psychological tools and other metrics to examine a range of effects and to assess the safety. The primary outcomes in both studies were depression and anxiety. Secondary outcomes were broad and included measurements to assess spirituality, existential distress, death anxiety, death transcendence, mystical experience, and quality of life. The psilocybin intervention and control groups both received guided psychotherapy during the monitoring of the intervention. One of the more interesting findings in these two studies is the significant association or correlation between the subjects' mystical-type experience and the therapeutic outcomes of the reduction in depression and anxiety. The link between ineffable spiritual experiences and our capacity for psychological well-being may point to a model for therapeutic modalities that have hitherto not been considered for depression and anxiety, for example interventions that awaken our inner capacity for meaning and transcendence.

635,1607,1607,Belser A.,Psychosocial distress in advanced cancer patients: An overview of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy and the ongoing New York University Phase II pilot study,"Purpose: The primary objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study is to assess the efficacy of psilocybin administration (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), a serotonergic psychoactive agent, on psychosocial distress, with the specific primary outcome variable being anxiety associated with advanced, recurrent or potentially life threatening cancer. Researchers at New York University School of Medicine and Bluestone Center for Clinical Research are conducting this Phase II pilot study investigating the effects of psilocybin on anxiety and psychosocial distress in advanced cancer patients. Psilocybin is a psychoactive agent found in a specific type of mushroom and used for centuries for religious and spiritual purposes. This study is separate but similar to a recently completed study at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, and to an ongoing study at the Johns Hopkins University. A secondary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to this patient population, with regards to the following issues: safety, patient recruitment, consent for treatment, and retention. Methods: The study utilizes a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design at 7 weeks and includes prospective follow-up of 6 months duration. The dose of psilocybin is 0.3mg/kg and the total subjects for the study is 32. Nine sessions of psychotherapy are conducted with two dedicated therapists, constituting a therapeutic dyad. Secondary outcome measures will look at the effect of psilocybin on symptoms of pain perception, depression, existential/ psychospiritual distress, attitudes towards disease progression and death, quality of life, and spiritual/mystical states of consciousness. Stephen Ross, M.D., Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at Bellevue Hospital, is the Principal Investigator of this project. Subject enrollment began in April, 2009. Results: As this Phase II study is currently underway, we have collected preliminary data; relevant outcomes from our sister studies at UCLA and Johns Hopkins will be addressed. We will present an overview of the study design and hope to foster collaboration between professionals dedicated to studying and facilitating cancer treatment and researchers using this novel compound and therapy modality. Conclusion: It is hypothesized that a one time experience with psilocybin will occasion dramatic shifts in consciousness and meaningful spiritual experiences that will lead to short-term and long-term improvement in anxiety, depression, and pain associated with advanced cancer.",NA,2010,J.

Die vorliegende Arbeit fasst die aktuelle Evidenz zur substanzunterstutzten Psychotherapie mit serotonergen Psychoaktiva zusammen. Methode: Eine selektive Literaturrecherche erfolgte in PubMed und der Cochrane Library, wobei nach Studien gesucht wurde, in denen der Einsatz von serotonergen Psychoaktiva in der Psychotherapie seit 2000 untersucht wurde. Ergebnisse: Es fanden sich Studien fur die folgenden Behandlungsindikationen: Alkoholabhangigkeit (LSD und Psilocybin), Nikotinabhangigkeit (Psilocybin), Behandlung von Angst und Depression bei lebensbedrohlicher korperlicher Erkrankung (LSD und Psilocybin), Zwangsstorungen (Psilocybin), therapieresistente Major Depression (Psilocybin) und posttraumatische Belastungsstorung (MDMA). Diskussion: Abhangigkeitserkrankungen, posttraumatische Belastungsstorung sowie Angst und Depression bei lebensbedrohlicher korperlicher Erkrankung stellen derzeit die am besten evaluierten Indikationen fur die substanzunterstutzte Psychotherapie mit serotonergen Psychoaktiva dar. Bisher zeigten sich Hinweise fur eine Wirksamkeit bei relativ guter Vertraglichkeit.

687,1469,1469,Halberstadt A.L. and Geyer M.A.,Serotonergic hallucinogens as translational models relevant to schizophrenia,"Abstract One of the oldest models of schizophrenia is based on the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens such as mescaline, psilocybin, and (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which act through the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. These compounds produce a 'model psychosis' in normal individuals that resembles at least some of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

Proposed mechanisms include direct projection and disinhibited feedback mechanisms, in which information from two otherwise structurally or functionally separate brain regions mix.

Studies of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, LSD and mescaline, reveal that exposure to these drugs can induce synesthesia. One neurotransmitter suspected to be central to the perceptual changes is serotonin. Excessive serotonin in the brain may cause many of the characteristics of psychedelic intoxication. Excessive serotonin levels may also play a role in synesthesia acquired after brain injury. In brain injury sudden cell death floods local brain regions with serotonin and glutamate. This neurotransmitter flooding could perhaps result in unusual feature binding. Finally, developmental synesthesia that occurs in individuals with autism may be a result of alterations in the serotonergic system, leading to a blockage of regular gating mechanisms.

Nevertheless, one report indicates that the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin increases PPI in healthy humans. Hence, we investigated these inconsistent results by assessing the dose-dependent effects of psilocybin on PPI in healthy humans. Sixteen subjects each received placebo or 115, 215, and 315 mug/kg of psilocybin at 4-week intervals in a randomized and counterbalanced order. PPI at 30-, 60-, 120-, 240-, and 2000-ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs) was measured 90 and 165 min after drug intake, coinciding with the peak and post-peak effects of psilocybin. The effects of psilocybin on psychopathological core dimensions and sustained attention were assessed by the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC) and the Frankfurt Attention Inventory (FAIR). Psilocybin dose-dependently reduced PPI at short (30 ms), had no effect at medium (60 ms), and increased PPI at long (120-2000 ms) ISIs, without affecting startle reactivity or habituation. Psilocybin dose-dependently impaired sustained attention and increased all 5D-ASC scores with exception of Auditory Alterations. Moreover, psilocybin-induced impairments in sustained attention performance were positively correlated with reduced PPI at the 30 ms ISI and not with the concomitant increases in PPI observed at long ISIs. These results confirm the psilocybin-induced increase in PPI at long ISIs and reveal that psilocybin also produces a decrease in PPI at short ISIs that is correlated with impaired attention and consistent with deficient PPI in schizophrenia.

The factor structures of the HRS and ARCI were found to differ from the factor structures originally proposed for those scales. The factor structure of the MEQ was found to roughly match the four factor structure identified in large-sample, online surveys and a smaller sample of experimental laboratory data, with psilocybin; however, Bouso et al. suggested that an alternate two-factor structure for the MEQ was most appropriate.

Music is considered an important component in the treatment model, but little empirical research has been done to examine the magnitude and nature of its therapeutic role. Objectives: The present study assessed the influence of music on the acute experience and clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews inquired about the different ways in which music influenced the experience of 19 patients undergoing psychedelic therapy with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to the interview data to identify salient themes. In addition, ratings were given for each patient for the extent to which they expressed ""liking,"" ""resonance"" (the music being experienced as ""harmonious"" with the emotional state of the listener), and ""openness"" (acceptance of the music-evoked experience). Results: Analyses of the interviews revealed that the music had both ""welcome"" and ""unwelcome"" influences on patients' subjective experiences. Welcome influences included the evocation of personally meaningful and therapeutically useful emotion and mental imagery, a sense of guidance, openness, and the promotion of calm and a sense of safety. Conversely, unwelcome influences included the evocation of unpleasant emotion and imagery, a sense of being misguided and resistance. Correlation analyses showed that patients' experience of the music was associated with the occurrence of ""mystical experiences"" and ""insightfulness."" Crucially, the nature of the music experience was significantly predictive of reductions in depression 1 week after psilocybin, whereas general drug intensity was not. Conclusions: This study indicates that music plays a central therapeutic function in psychedelic therapy.Copyright Â© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-017-4820-5,2018,Psychopharmacology,235,2,505-519,NA,NA,NA

In addition, ratings were given for each patient for the extent to which they expressed ""liking,"" ""resonance"" (the music being experienced as ""harmonious"" with the emotional state of the listener), and ""openness"" (acceptance of the music-evoked experience). Results: Analyses of the interviews revealed that the music had both ""welcome"" and ""unwelcome"" influences on patients' subjective experiences. Welcome influences included the evocation of personally meaningful and therapeutically useful emotion and mental imagery, a sense of guidance, openness, and the promotion of calm and a sense of safety. Conversely, unwelcome influences included the evocation of unpleasant emotion and imagery, a sense of being misguided and resistance. Correlation analyses showed that patients' experience of the music was associated with the occurrence of ""mystical experiences"" and ""insightfulness."" Crucially, the nature of the music experience was significantly predictive of reductions in depression 1 week after psilocybin, whereas general drug intensity was not. Conclusions: This study indicates that music plays a central therapeutic function in psychedelic therapy.

However, the two studies differed in several important respects. The NYU study had a smaller sample size (N=29) than the JHU study (N=51).

Childhood memories forgotten until then were emotionally relived, in particular her separation from the person she considered as her second mother. The first episode of anorexia at about the age of 6 was thus explained. It was this second injection of psilocybin which brought about the definitive recovery of the patient.

826,1326,1326,Krebs M.-O.,Therese Lemperiere: Her works on psychotropic and current perspectives,"Objectives: This paper is a tribute to Therese Lemperiere's legacy regarding the study of psychotropic substances and an analysis of the lessons from her work for the future of psychopharmacology. Materials and methods: All her historical papers, mainly published in French journals, were reviewed as well as the summary of ""titles and works"" written by her. Rather than a comprehensive review, we have selected some papers in order to cover the various domains she addressed and to highlight some main characteristics of her work and envision. The paper also analyze her work in the context of the remarkable progresses of psychopharmacology in the second part of the 20th century as well as new perspectives for future innovations. Results: Therese Lemperiere started studying psychotropic drugs in 1953, in the department where the antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine were discovered. In the same line as these pioneering observations, her work widely covers the study of various compounds, with a specific interest for clinical descriptions of therapeutic effects in patients of new drugs as well as induction of symptoms by substance of abuse in patients or healthy volunteers. She explored every classes of the classification proposed by J. Delay in 1957 (adopted by the 1961 World Congress of Psychiatry) i.e. psycholeptics including neuroleptics and mood stabilizers, psychoanaleptics such as nooanaleptics (amphetamine) and thymoanaleptics (antidepressants) and psychodysleptics especially psilocybine. Regarding amphetamine, T. Lemperiere discussed the differential diagnosis between pharmacopsychose and what she called 'amphetaminic pseudopsychosis' when psychosis persist after withdrawal and proposed that amphetamine reveals previously quiescent predisposition to schizophrenia. She underlined the bidirectional relation: amphetamine induces psychosis but also amphetamine as a self-medication for early dysfunction of schizophrenia. A picture very similar to current view on cannabis precipitated psychosis or self-medication by cocaine. T. Lemperiere studied several classes of antidepressant from the early tricyclic to very recent ones. In the 'two-year of experience with imipramine' article, she reviewed the best indications and factors of good response (melancholia, simple depression, women) while imipramine has low efficacy in severe melancholia and hypochondria. She proposed the association of imipramine to reduce the number of ECT and indicate some efficacy in OCD. The descriptions of psilocybine in healthy volunteers and patients are full of information regarding the individual variability and the semiology of psychotic-like experiences induced by psilocybine (illusions, ""hallucinose"", pseudohallucinations rather than hallucinations). Of course, Therese Lemperiere's explored the neuroleptics, many of them, with a special focus to analyze the differential therapeutic profile of each molecule, in order to improve the adequacy to the patient's profile. A main contribution was the study of reserpine, starting in 1954, that, together with the observation with chlorpromazine, contributed to the definition the of neuroleptics' class. These included the presence of extra pyramidal signs, which Therese Lemperiere also explored, including tardive dyskinesia. She rapidly recommended to prescribe neuroleptic at the minimal efficient dose and to avoid systematic prescription of anticholinergic drug. Therese Lemperiere promoted the use of long acting neuroleptics early in the disease, since they prevent treatment interruption and facilitate the alliance. Regarding the mood stabilizers, Therese Lemperiere contributed to the introduction of valpromide and valproate in psychiatry. Conclusions: Therese Lemperiere is a pioneer woman in French Psychiatry, and her legacy is not restricted to the field of psychopharmacology. Her remarkable contribution is mainly due to her clinical vision and analysis. The overview of the Therese Lemperiere's contribution to psychopharmacology underline several features of the early history of psychopharmacology: the origin of psychotropic drugs out of neurosciences (antibacterial, antiparasitic, antihypertensive, etc.), the close relation between clinician and chemists from pharmaceutical company, rapid transfer to the clinic and rapid feedback to the pharmaceutical companies, the fine clinical (phenotypic) descriptions, the use of psychotropic drugs to dissect psychiatric syndromes. These are invaluable lessons to apply for the future developments of psychopharmacology. They plead for a reinforcement of translational psychiatry with always more bidirectional relations between clinics and basic sciences and advocate for reopening the borders between psychiatry and other medical disciplines.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2015.09.008,2015,Ann.

Historic and anecdotal evidence shows that natural sources of ""psychedelic"" drugs (e.g., mescaline and psilocybin) have been used in religious and spiritual settings for centuries, as well as for psychological self-enhancement purposes. Our study assessed a total of 667 psychedelic drug users, other drug users, and drug nonusers by online questionnaires. Coping, life purpose, and spirituality were measured with the Psychological Immune Competence Inventory, the Purpose in Life test, and the Intrinsic Spirituality Scale, respectively. Results indicate that the use of psychedelic drugs with a purpose to enhance self-knowledge is less associated with problems, and correlates positively with coping and spirituality. Albeit the meaning of ""spirituality"" may be ambiguous, it seems that a spiritually-inclined attitude in drug use may act as a protective factor against drug-related problems. The autognostic use of psychedelic drugs may be thus hypothesized as a ""training situation"" that promotes self-enhancement by rehearsing personal coping strategies and by gaining self-knowledge. However, to assess the actual efficiency and the speculated long-term benefits of these deliberately provoked exceptional experiences, further qualitative investigations are needed.

Historic and anecdotal evidence shows that natural sources of ""psychedelic"" drugs (e.g., mescaline and psilocybin) have been used in religious and spiritual settings for centuries, as well as for psychological self-enhancement purposes. Our study assessed a total of 667 psychedelic drug users, other drug users, and drug nonusers by online questionnaires. Coping, life purpose, and spirituality were measured with the Psychological Immune Competence Inventory, the Purpose in Life test, and the Intrinsic Spirituality Scale, respectively. Results indicate that the use of psychedelic drugs with a purpose to enhance self-knowledge is less associated with problems, and correlates positively with coping and spirituality. Albeit the meaning of ""spirituality"" may be ambiguous, it seems that a spiritually-inclined attitude in drug use may act as a protective factor against drug-related problems. The autognostic use of psychedelic drugs may be thus hypothesized as a ""training situation"" that promotes self-enhancement by rehearsing personal coping strategies and by gaining self-knowledge. However, to assess the actual efficiency and the speculated long-term benefits of these deliberately provoked exceptional experiences, further qualitative investigations are needed.

905,2668,2668,Roubicek J. and Drvota S.,Psilocybin - A new phantasticum,"Psilocybin is a psychotrophic hallucinogenic substance prepared from the Mexican fungus Psilocybe mexicana Heim, isolated in the Sandoz laboratories in crystalline form. In milligramme doses it produces a psychotic condition lasting several hours, characterized by sensory hallucinations, marked depersonalizations, signs of hypomania and euphoria with conditions of 'beatitude' with a loss of interest in the environment, disorders in perception of space, and time and other less regular psychic changes. It is associated with the following somatic symptoms: mydriasis, tendon hyperreflexia, bradycardia, fatigue. In about one-third of intoxicated persons there are uncomfortable vegetative symptoms, vertigo, nausea, tremor, perspiration - all these symptoms being mild. In the EEG there are mild signs of desynchronization, sometimes a more rapid alpha-rhythm, a decrease of its amplitude and a general flattening of the curve and an increase of beta-waves. As compared with other known hallucinogens, particularly mescalin and LSD 25, there are many similarities and some differences. The depersonalization after psilocybin is not so intense, the altered perception of space, is, however, more marked, the 'good humour and feeling of happiness' is more marked, while the vegetative symptoms are milder. The authors summarize the comparison in a table. Personal experiences (autointoxication) are described in detail and supplemented by drawings made during the intoxication and immediately after it. The drawings contain characteristic manifestations of geometrical and ornamental stylization with motifs of concentric zones with a loose composition whirly changes of pictures which are difficult to perceive, with disproportions of figural motifs with a disintegration of the body composition, with mutually penetrating ideas.",NA,1960,Csl.

911,2137,2137,Gebhart E.,Problems of mutagenic side effects of psychotropic substances,"Some psychotropic drugs belong to the group of substances most intensively studied at the present time, for chromosome damaging effects in man. However, since only the action of each particular drug on lymphocytes in the G0-phase is considered, and since the amount of experimental data is still fairly low, the mutagenic risk of psychotropic substances cannot yet be finally estimated. However, past experience has shown that the true psychopharmaca are not, or are only very slightly mutagenic. A definite mutagenic effect, however, if only a weak one, can be attributed to several combinations of anticonvulsive drugs, as well as to the single preparations diphenylhydantoin and primidon, to uncontrolled consumption of addictive drugs and to alcoholism.",NA,1979,FORTSCHR.

Toxins contained in Danish wild mushrooms],"A number of the wild Danish mushrooms contain the hallucinogenic agent psilocybin which resembles LSD in many ways. The commonest of these are the ""liberty cap"" or ""magic mushrooms"" (Psilocybe semilanceata). On the basis of experience from USA and western Europa, increase in employment of this mushrooms as a hallucinogenic intoxicant may be anticipated in Denmark. The history, epidemiology, botany and pharmacology of the mushroom are reviewed. Clinical pictures and treatment are described for: 1) Acute poisoning with psilocybin-containing fungi, 2) Late sequelae of consumption of psilocybin-containing fungi and 3) Poisoning with more poisonous fungi on account of incorrect identification. General practitioners, duty roster doctors, doctors in casualty departments and in acute psychiatric departments should be aware of these problems. Intoxication with psilocybin may be confused with panic anxiety or euphoria in persons with mydriasis and other sympathomimetic symptoms. The possibility of more serious mushroom poisoning on account of incorrect identification should be borne in mind.",NA,1990,Ugeskr Laeger,152,5,314-7,NA,NA,NA

The potentials evoked by stimulation with light and sound were evaluated with computed averages (Enhancetron 1024). The potentials were derived from the occipital area and a nonspecific cortical area. Whereas the drug has a very marked effect on the visually evoked potential, it only causes a discrete change in the potentials evoked in a nonspecific area; a reduced amplitude was found, especially in the late waves. These changes are not attributable to habituation or to a change in the state of vigilance of the animal.",NA,1967,C. R. Soc. Biol,161,1,147-150,NA,NA,NA

920,2622,2622,Grof S.,The problem of optic disturbances in auto-experiments with hallucinogens,"This paper summarizes personal introspective observations of disturbed optic perception in auto-experiments with 3 hallucinogens (LSD-25, mescaline, psilocybine). The dynamics and development of these disorders are described and attention is drawn to the difference between phenomena observed with the eyes closed and with the eyes open. Experiments with small doses of the preparation and the period of onset and recession of psychotic changes are particularly suited for these observations as under these conditions the illusions and pseudohallucinations do not arise spontaneously but only when the eyes are fixed and when the subject collaborates actively. Attention is drawn to the analogy between the mechanism of the genesis of optic disturbances in model psychoses and the search for different interpretations in Rorschach's tables. This analogy is demonstrated by a comparison of the graphic records of successive illusory transformations of a single object during LSD psychosis and some specimens of a drawn Rorschach protocol. In conclusion the importance of the mechanism described is discussed for the understanding of the pathoplastic aspect of model psychoses and the relationship of some observed phenomena to the problem of naturally occurring mental disorders.",NA,1964,Cs.
